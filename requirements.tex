\section{Design Constraints}
ethical issue:
	- data collection
    - putting the user under stress "on purpose"
pricey measuring tool (if we want to get more precious measurement)
user data:
	- permission from the user to access and use the data
    - type of data that we can analyze
	- should psychologist be able to access raw data?
	- data transmission
	- who can access it
    - what can they do with it

I am not sure which are functional and which are not, I will list them below and please help me put them under the right category.

1. Inform the importance of emotional resilience, especially for the parents
2. Help the user develop emotional resilience
3. Able to tell if the user is under stress
4. Able to tell and measure the user's stress level
5. Keep track of the user's progress
6. Provide personalized training, which can be based on:
     - how "easily" they will be stressed
     - how the user "shift" between different levels of stress
     - the user's progress
