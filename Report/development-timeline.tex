\chapter{Development Timeline}

This development timeline documents the periods of time we will spend on three main areas: soft deliverables involving reports and writeups about our software, development work on the initial operating system, and development work on the final operating system. It focuses on how long we will be working on individual subtasks, and how long we will be working on overall phases of the program.
