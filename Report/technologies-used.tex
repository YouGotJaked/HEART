\chapter{Technologies Used} \label{tech-used} % Jake [DONE]

Several of the technologies we are choosing are based off their relevant functionality as well as any previous knowledge members had with these technologies. This allows us to move forward quicker and more efficiently with our project. Our software technologies include Apple HealthKit, C\#, Google VR SDK for Unity, ResearchKit, Unity Engine, and Xcode. We also are using Google Cardboard for our hardware technology. Finally, GitHub will be used as our version control system to store all our code.
