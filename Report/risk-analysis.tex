\section{Risk Analysis Table}

Our team identified the most common and severe risks during the software development process. Table \ref{table:risk-anal} presents these risks, along with their potential consequences and solutions. The impact of each risk results from the product of their respective probability and severity. The risks are listed from highest to lowest impact.
