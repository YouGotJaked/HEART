\chapter{Use Cases} % Yutong / Jake [DONE]

The two actors involved are users and developers. Each of their respective functions are listed in Figure~\ref{fig:use-cases}.

\section{User Use Cases}
The users can play the game from both their own perspective, which will be interacting with a virtual child, and the child's perspective. The users can also keep track of their personal progress by checking out the report generated.

\section{Developer Use Cases}

With the system, the developers are able to develop personalize "training plan" based on the user data, while the users can play game and keep track of their personal progress. The developers can decide the stress level for the user by analyzing the collected user data. While measuring the current stress level of the user, the developers can adjust then the difficulty of the game based on the user's stress level in real time.
